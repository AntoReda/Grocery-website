# How to run
-To run these files as dynamic pages, you need a localhost intsalled (I used XAMPP and WAMP).<br/> 
-Download either the entire zip file or the .7z file and extract it.<br/> 
-Then add this folder to your localhost file location (for XAMPP place it under htdocs, for WAMP place it under www).<br/> 
-then open your browser and type: localhost/verdi/P1.php<br/> 
-This will load the main menu page and you can navigate from there.<br/> 
-To run these files as dynamic pages, rename all the files starting with P as a .html instead of .php (keep in mind the add to cart and other dynamic functions will not work its only to view the HTML and CSS.<br/>
